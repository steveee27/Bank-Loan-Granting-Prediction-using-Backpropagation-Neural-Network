# Bank-Loan-Granting-Prediction-using-Backpropagation-Neural-Network-BPNN-
This project aims to build a model that predicts whether a loan application will be granted based on customer features such as age, income, credit history, and more. Using the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) architecture, the model is trained to classify loan approvals as either "approved" or "denied."
